# Browser Email Client

![logo-email-sender](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c4fe7b6-7ad0-4180-b016-b2a773124807)

Simple interface using the PHPMailer library to send emails from a PHP server. This tool kind of reinvents the wheel by being just an email client inside the browser. It was built for a client to make sending HTML emails to a moderate number of recipients easier. It was also an excuse to build something using htmx.

Beware, Mailchimp.
